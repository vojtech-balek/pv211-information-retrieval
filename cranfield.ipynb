    "# First Term Project: Cranfield Collection\n",
    "“The Cranfield collection [...] was the pioneering test collection in allowing CRANFIELD precise quantitative measures of information retrieval effectiveness [...]. Collected in the United Kingdom starting in the late 1950s, it contains 1398 abstracts of aerodynamics journal articles, a set of 225 queries, and exhaustive relevance judgments of all (query, document) pairs.” [1, Section 8.2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Your tasks, reviewed by your colleagues and the course instructors, are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   *Implement an unsupervised ranked retrieval system*, [1, Chapter 6] which will produce a list of documents from the Cranfield collection in a descending order of relevance to a query from the Cranfield collection. You MUST NOT use relevance judgements from the Cranfield collection in your information retrieval system. Relevance judgements MUST only be used for the evaluation of your information retrieval system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.   *Document your code* in accordance with [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/), ideally using [the NumPy style guide](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard) as seen in the code from exercises.  \n",
    "     *Stick to a consistent coding style* in accordance with [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.   *Reach at least 22% mean average precision* [1, Section 8.4] with your system on the Cranfield collection. You MUST record your score either in [the public leaderboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT0FoFzCptIYKDsbcv8LebhZDe_20GFeBAPmS-VyImlWbqET0T7I2iWy59p9SHbUe3LX1yJMhALPcCY/pubhtml) or in this Jupyter notebook. You are encouraged to use techniques for tokenization, [1, Section 2.2] document representation [1, Section 6.4], tolerant retrieval [1, Chapter 3], relevance feedback and query expansion, [1, Chapter 9] and others discussed in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.   _[Upload an .ipynb file](https://is.muni.cz/help/komunikace/spravcesouboru#k_ss_1) with this Jupyter notebook to the homework vault in IS MU._ You MAY also include a brief description of your information retrieval system and a link to an external service such as [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), [DeepNote](https://deepnote.com/), or [JupyterHub](https://iirhub.cloud.e-infra.cz/).\n",
